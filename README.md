## React-Portfolio

## Description
Being a web developer means being part of a community. Youâ€™ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Dependencies
npm install
npm start & npm run deploy
